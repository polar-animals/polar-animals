            <article>
                Snowy owls inhabits the tundra and the Great horned owl inhabits some parts
                 of South America and all of North America, except the nothest regions.Due to
                 it's habitat, snowy owl diet isn't diverse. As a result it leads to diffrent
                 diseases. Also snowy owl's average lifespan in the wild (8.5 years) is lower
                 than it's brown mate (11 years). The great brown owl however can have a richer 
                 diet but due to higher metabolism, it's forced to hunt frequently and doesn't 
                 respond well to lack of pray. On the other hand snowy owl has high fat deposit.
                 This means that in bad food condtitions, they can survive the period simply
                 by decreasing their activity.
