            Massive, strong with killing instincts, polar bears are tough predators 
        in a harash enviroment. They are at the top of the food chain and their 
        diet is entirely meat based. Quite fearsome but still tender and loving 
        to their sweet precious cubs.

        <h1>Polar Bear<span> VS </span>Grizly Bear</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <article>
                Polar bear's mass(680 kg or 1300 lb) is higher than grizlly's (270 kg). Same goes for their height. 
                    Polar bear diet is entirely meat while grizzly's eat some berries and fish in addition. Also they 
                    have sharper teeth, strong paws, compact bone structure and are more agresive than polar bears. To put
                    it simply grizly bears are small compared to polar bears, but have stronger body. It's hard to tell who
                    would win in a fight, but due to global warning polar bears might disticts. Grizzly's species is save 
                    from that due to higher geographic range and population. So in the end, not necessary in a physical 
                    fight, grizzly would win against polar bear.
