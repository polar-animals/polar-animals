            Being a tiny animal in an enviroment with extremly low temperatures, 
            lack of food and tough predators isn't an easy job. Small and clever, 
            Arctic fox manages to resist the harash enviroment and continue to be interesting
            to explore and adorable.

                Climate change has allowed red foxes to expand their geographic range, which
            overlaped with arctic foxes habitat. Unfortunately those two species cannot
            coexist in one ecosystem due to the same diet they share. This leads to arctic foxes
            being prayed by their red natives who weight aproximently twice as them. Even thought
            arctic foxes are better adapted to the arctic if in an area red foxes
            and their white natives population is too high, then the arctic foxes number is more likely
            to drop down. Arctic foxes would never extinct entirely only due to red foxes since they
            can be found in Iceland and Greenland but red foxes don't habit those areas.
