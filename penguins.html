            Penguins are classified as birds, but they have adjusted to swimming rather than 
        flying. They are excelent swimmers which helps them catch their pray. It's 
        common knowledge that penguins inhabit Antarctica but that's not true about some 
        species.

        <h1>Empereor Penguin<span> VS </span>Litle Penguin</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <article>
                Empereor penguin is the tallest and heviest among the penguin's species. 
                    It inhabits the Antarctic and isn't prayed by any animal on ground. On the 
                    other hand, litle penguin inhabits south coasts of Australia and New Zeland. 
                    Unlike Empereor penguin it is prayed on ground from cats, dogs, rats, foxes, 
                    large reptiles ect. Althought these disadvantages, litle penguins population
                    is about 1 milion while Empereor's is 600 000. That might be because litle 
                    penguins are more likely to recieve help from humans, than empereors due to the
                    more hospitable enviroment they inhabit. Some organizations even offer adopting
                    a little penguin, donation and ect.
