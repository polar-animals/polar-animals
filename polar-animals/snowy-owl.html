    <h2>Snowy Owl<span> VS </span>Horned Owl</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <div>
            Snowy owls inhabits the tundra and the Great horned owl inhabits some parts of South America and all of North America,
            except the nothest regions.Due to it's habitat, snowy owl diet isn't diverse. As a result it leads to different diseases.
            Also snowy owl's average lifespan in the wild (8.5 years) is lower than it's brown mate (11 years). The great brown owl
            however can have a richer diet but due to higher metabolism, it's forced to hunt frequently and doesn't respond well
            to lack of pray. On the other hand snowy owl has high fat deposit. This means that in bad food conditions, they can
            survive the period simply by decreasing their activity.
