    <h2>Snowy Owl<span> VS </span>Horned Owl</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <div>
            Snowy owls inhabits the tundra. The Great horned equivalent inhabits some parts of South America and all of North America,
            except the northernmost regions. The snowy specie doesn't have diverse diet. This leads to different diseases.
            Also it's average lifespan in the wild is 8.5 years. This is lower than it's brown mate - 11 years. The southern mate
            has a richer diet and higher metabolism. This forces it to hunt frequently and doesn't respond well
            to lack of pray. On the other hand it's northern friend has high fat deposit. So survives longer in lack of food.
            The key is to decrease it's activity.
